 Airplane Seat Reservation System is a 2D console based business application that allows an airplane to reserve their seats. It asks the passenger in which class he/she wants to reserve seat, then the system asks about the seat passenger wants to rreserve. Then, it checks wether the seat is available or not. If seat is available then it gets reserved. If seat is not available, then it will ask the customer to select another seat.
<br>
Admin can also see which seats are reserved and which are available.
